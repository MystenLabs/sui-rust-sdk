//! OCS (Object Checkpoint State) proof verification.
//!
//! The Object Checkpoint State is the Blake2b256 Merkle tree built by each
//! checkpoint over the set of object references it modified, with leaves
//! arranged in ascending `ObjectID` order (see
//! [`crate::merkle`] for the underlying tree primitive). The tree's root
//! is committed to by the containing [`CheckpointSummary`] via the
//! [`CheckpointCommitment::CheckpointArtifacts`] variant of its
//! `checkpoint_commitments`.
//!
//! This module defines the proof envelopes that an SDK consumer verifies
//! against a *trusted* checkpoint summary:
//!
//! - [`OcsInclusionProof`] proves that a specific [`ObjectReference`]
//!   appears in the tree.
//! - [`OcsNonInclusionProof`] proves that a specific [`ObjectReference`]
//!   does not appear in the tree.
//! - [`OcsProof`] tags one of the two.
//!
//! Verification only checks the data-relation half of the proof: it
//! reconstructs the `CheckpointArtifactsDigest` from the proof's `tree_root`
//! and asserts it matches the digest committed to by the summary's
//! `CheckpointArtifacts` commitment. Authenticating the checkpoint summary
//! itself (verifying its BLS aggregate signature against the epoch's
//! validator committee) is a separate step performed by the caller, e.g.
//! via `sui-crypto`'s `ValidatorCommitteeSignatureVerifier`.
